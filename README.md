# BOOKSA

BOOKSA stands for Booking Services Application. This is a personal project  - using Qt, CMAKE and modern C++ (C++14 and C++17) features - intended to serve as a practice workspace for improving those skills while applying DDD (Domain Driven Development).
The final goal is to implement a complete cross-platform Booking Application for any kind of company, where Management can register Services or Products, with their respective price and execution time (for services only), allowing later for clients to schedule/book services or simply do shopping.

## Current Status

Development is still in its early stage, where the main Domain classes were defined, but can still be modified or have auxiliar ones added later.
